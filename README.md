California has suffered greatly from wildfires in recent years, with serious repercussions for its people, environment, and economy. The diverse terrain of the state, along with climate change and human activities, has left it susceptible to regular and severe wildfires. These fires not only act as direct threats to life and property but also cause enduring damage to the environment, atmospheric conditions, and community health. It's essential to grasp the underlying patterns and reasons behind these wildfires to manage, prevent, and reduce their effects more effectively.

The objective is to create a predictive model that can analyze past wildfire data in California. We aim to track how often and how severely wildfires occur, pinpoint their main causes, understand where they're most likely to happen, and evaluate their effects on people and property. By using data mining techniques, this model is critical given California's ongoing wildfire challenges. Ultimately, the aim is to offer quick and useful information that helps both communities and officials make smarter decisions and reduce risks associated with wildfires.
